# Simple HUE function (2022)
> [Old repo (main)](https://github.com/GetMbr/My-first-HSL-code-C-/tree/main)

Actually wrote this based on my outcome that came to my mind back in 2022, a little bit of tweaks and trial and error, </br>
but still managed it to work anyways. Somehow a little mistake here, as it would reset all the RGB variables           </br>
back to zero when blue reaches 255.                                                                                    </br>

### UPDATE (as of 2025年10月20日)
The new hue code can finally shift without resetting to zero when the blue reaches 255, thanks to phases, which I later  </br>
find out about it, and also modern features like lambdas which can make the code much shorter and easier while classes   </br>
can make it run on multiple instances without the values getting mixed up when it got executed simutaneously between     </br>
different threads using the same function.                                                                               </br>
