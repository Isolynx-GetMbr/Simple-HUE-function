# Simple HUE function (2022)

Actually wrote this based on my outcome that came to my mind back in 2022, but a little bit of tweaks and trial and error, </br>
but still managed it to work anyways. But somehow a little mistake here, as it would reset all the RGB variables           </br>
back to zero when blue reaches 255.                                                                                        </br>

>[!NOTE]
> Probably going to fix the code for the results to be accurate instead of going
> back to zero when the RGB blue value finally reaches to 255.
